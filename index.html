			Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Juan DeBiedma. I'm a graduate in chemical engineering from the University of Florida who wanted to dive deeper into web development. I'm also a professional gamer on Team Liquid under the alias <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Debiedma">Hungrybox</a>. I was chosen as one of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/juan-debiedma/">Forbes' 30 Under 30</a> in the Gaming category this year, and recieved the award for the <a href="http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/18435817/2016-espn-esports-awards-moment-year">2016 ESPN Esports Moment of the Year.</a>

			While pursuing my degree I traveled around the country competing at major Super Smash Bros. Melee events to pay for my college education. While in college I also was a member of multiple acapella groups, a table tennis league, professional organzations for student & Hispanic engineers, and a student-run cooperative living organization. I hope that my portfolio helps to bring you an understanding of my passion for web design. Thank you very much!
